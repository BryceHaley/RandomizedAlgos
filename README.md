# Introduction

A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that takes random bits *r* as one of its inputs. Even if *r* is never used. True randomness (ie. a random oracle) is a mostly theoretical concern, and won't be discussed here. We will use deterministic methods (PRNGs, rand(), etc) to 'approximate' randomness.
